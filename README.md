![We present Push2AR, a novel interaction concept that enhances scroll list interaction on phones by pushing list items
to the AR space. (a+b) The user bookmarks an item by sliding it into AR space. (c) Bookmarked items in AR are aligned to their respective position on the smartphone. Items outside the smartphone’s screen space are gradually stacked at the top and bottom. All photos are live recordings from the head-mounted display.](/figures/push2ar.jpg?raw=true)
