## Building and running locally

Build scripts are tested on **Mac**. These will probably work on Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux, but I have not tested them.

- Make sure you have Node.js 19.7.0 or later installed
- Open the folder containing this README
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`

Continue the process with the steps listed below.

### Firefox

- Open Firefox's [debugging page](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) (`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`)
- Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
- Navigate to this project's root and select `manifest.json`
